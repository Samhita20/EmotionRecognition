I haven't had Dominos pizza in at least 20 years ! I only visited this time because they were promoting their annual Sick kids hospital day. They freshly made the pizza. We bought the pepperoni pizza. It was exremely fresh.  The crust was crunchy and doughy, just the way I like it. Amazing ! I loved it. It is the best plain pepperoni pizza I've ever had ! We ordered 2 more to bring home.
